# Progress report
I finished the backend challenge, started the frontend challenge, and then recieved an offer from a different company. Keeping the repo up because I like the little backend thing I made. 

# Backend challenge
**Tech used:**
Node.js, express.js, and mongoDB.

**Images from:** [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos/) (which gets its images from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/))

**Link:** [Hosted on heroku](https://shopify-2021s-backend.herokuapp.com/login)

## Instructions:
- **Home page:** left mostly as a 404 page
- **Marketplace**: shows the first few available images from each user in the database
- **Individual image pages**: shows the enlarged image, and the info from the picsum.photos api
- **Login page**: explains which users you can log in as

Once you're logged in...
- Marketplace and individual image pages show "buy" buttons (unless you're already the owner of it)
- Purchase mechanism has decent error handling, and will render the reason for a failed purchase
- Your dashboard shows the images you own

## Notes:
- Small rendering bugs right after a purchase; may not reflect the current state of the database until a refresh

# Frontend challenge
Not done. Might do this one day for fun, might not.
