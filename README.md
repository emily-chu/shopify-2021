## If you're reading thisâ€“ my apologies!

I scheduled to complete both the frontend and backend challenges as if they were due by the technical interview, and not for the application handin. 
Then, I reread the application and realized these might be part of the picking-candidates-for-interviews process...
An event and some training will have me tied up until the 11th, but I'll certainly have this done by the 16th (a day before the job application deadline).

Thanks for understanding! :)
